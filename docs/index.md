# Welcome!

This website hosts the labs that will be used during each CAPP Camp session:

- **August 22**: Introduction to Linux
- **August 23**: Git I
- **August 24**: Git II
- **August 26**: Python Programming

Before the camp kickoff, download the required software listed in [Pre-Installation](./pre-installation/index.md). If you encounter problems, post a question to [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/24735/discussion/) describing your operating system (OS) version, steps leading up to the error, and observed error message. Your instructors, teaching assistants, and fellow classmates will respond to help troubleshoot.

The [Advanced](./advanced/index.md) section contains optional content that will not be covered in the camp or 30121 but may be helpful for future coursework.
