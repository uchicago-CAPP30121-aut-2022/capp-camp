# Visual Studio Code Layout


## The Terminal
On your personal computer, you probably navigate your hard drive by double clicking on icons. While convenient for simple tasks, this approach is limited. For example, imagine that you want to delete all of the music files over 5 MB that you haven’t listened to in over a year. This task is very hard to do with the standard double-click interface but is relatively simple using the terminal.

A terminal window will open and you will see text of the form:

```bash
username@computer:~$
```

where `username` has been replaced by your CNetID and computer is the name of the machine you happen to be using. This string is called the prompt. When you start typing, the characters you type will appear to the right of the `$`.

The program that runs within a terminal window and processes the commands that you type is called a shell. We use bash, which is the default shell on most Linux distributions, but there are other popular shells, such as `ksh`, `tcsh`, etc.

The procedure for completing the remainder of the lab is as follows. For each section, read through the explanatory text and the examples. Then, try these ideas by doing the exercises listed at the bottom of the section. We show many examples of sample output. The output you see when you run the commands may vary a bit. For example, it is unlikely that your name is “Gustav Martin Larsson”.
