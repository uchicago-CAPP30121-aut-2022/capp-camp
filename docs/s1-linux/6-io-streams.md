# Working with Input/Output Streams

When you run a program (at the command-line or by clicking), the Linux operating system creates a new process for running the program. Every Linux process has an input stream (known as standard in) for providing input to a program and two output streams, one for regular output (known as standard out) and one for providing information about errors (known as standard error). In this section, you will learn how to use these streams to provide input to a program and to capture the output.

### Redirection

The examples in this section will use commands that we’ve not yet discussed. Refer to the man pages for information about unfamiliar commands.

As we already know, commands like `pwd` and `ls` will print output to screen by default. Sometimes, however, we may prefer to write the output of these commands to a file. In Linux, we can redirect the output of a program to a file of our choosing. This operation is done with the `>` operator.

Try the following example and compare your output with ours:

```bash
$ cd
$ touch test-0.txt
$ ls > test-1.txt
$ cat test-1.txt
Desktop
Documents
Downloads
Music
Pictures
Public
Templates
test-0.txt
test-1.txt
Videos
$ echo "Hello World!" > test-2.txt
$ cat test-2.txt
Hello World!
$ cat test-2.txt > test-1.txt; cat test-1.txt
Hello World!
$ rm test-*
```

Two important things to note:

1. If you redirect to a file that does not exist, that file will be created.

2. If you redirect to a file that already exists, the contents of that file will be overwritten.

You can use the append operator (`>>`) to append the output of command to the end of an existing file rather than overwrite the contents of that file.

Not only can we redirect the output of a program to a file, we can also have a program receive its input from a file. This operation is done with the `<` operator. For example:

```bash
$ python3 my_echo.py < my-input.txt
```

(Change back to your `lab1` directory before you try this command.)

In general, all Linux processes can perform input/output operations through, at least, the keyboard and the screen. More specifically, there are three "input/output streams": standard input (or `stdin`), standard output (or `stdout`), and standard error (or `stderr`). The code in `my_echo.py` simply reads information from `stdin` and writes it back out to `stdout`. The redirection operators change the bindings of these streams from the keyboard and/or screen to files. We’ll discuss `stderr` later in the term.

#### Exercises

1. Run `my_echo.py` as shown above.

2. Run `my_echo.py` again, but this time redirect the output to a file named `output.txt`. Check the contents of `output.txt` using an editor or by using the cat or more commands.

3. Run `my_echo.py` redirecting the input from test.txt and the output to `output2.txt`. Check the contents of `output2.txt`.

4. When you are done, remove `output.txt` and `output2.txt`.

By the way, if you run `python3 my_echo.py` without redirecting the input, it will patiently wait for you to type some input for it to echo. Once you type some input and hit return, the program will echo your input, and then resume waiting for input. It will continue to do so until you exit by typing `Ctrl-d`. Give it a try!

### Piping

In addition to the ability to direct output to and receive input from files, Linux provides a very powerful capability called piping. Piping allows one program to receive as input the output of another program, like so:

```bash
$ program1 | program2
```

In this example, the output of `program1` is used as the input of `program2`. Or to put it more technically, the `stdout` of `program1` is connected to the `stdin` of program2.

As another more concrete example, consider the `man` command with the `-k` option that we’ve previously discussed. Let’s assume that you hadn’t yet been introduced to the `mkdir` command. How would you look for the command to create a directory? First attempts:

```bash
$ man -k "create directory"
create directory: nothing appropriate
$ man -k "directory"
(a bunch of mostly irrelevant output)
```

As we can see, neither of these options is particularly helpful. However, with piping, we can combine `man -k` with a powerful command line utility called `grep` (see `man` pages) to find what we need:

```bash
$ man -k "directory" | grep "create"
mkdir (2)            - create a directory
mkdirat (2)          - create a directory
mkdtemp (3)          - create a unique temporary directory
mkfontdir (1)        - create an index of X font files in a directory
mklost+found (8)     - create a lost+found directory on a mounted Linux second extended fil...
mktemp (1)           - create a temporary file or directory
pam_mkhomedir (8)    - PAM module to create users home directory
update-info-dir (8)  - update or create index file from all installed info files in directory
vgmknodes (8)        - recreate volume group directory and logical volume special files
```

Nice.

#### Exercises

1. Use piping to chain together the `printenv` and `tail` commands to display the last 10 lines of output from `printenv`.

2. Replicate the above functionality without using the `|` operator. (Hint: Use a temporary file.)
